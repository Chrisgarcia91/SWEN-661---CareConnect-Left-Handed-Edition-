### Summary of AWS Resources

* **S3 Bucket Creation (`aws_s3_bucket`)**: It creates a new S3 bucket. The bucket's name is dynamically generated by combining a variable (`var.iac_bucket_name`) with your current AWS Account ID.

***

* **Bucket Versioning (`aws_s3_bucket_versioning`)**: This enables **versioning** on the bucket. This is a crucial feature that keeps a history of all object versions, preventing accidental data loss and allowing you to revert to previous states.

***

* **Default Encryption (`aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration`)**: It enforces **server-side encryption** using the `AES256` algorithm for all objects stored in the bucket. This ensures your data is always encrypted at rest. 🛡️

***

* **Event Notifications (`aws_s3_bucket_notification`)**: This configures the bucket to send event notifications (e.g., when a file is uploaded) to **Amazon EventBridge**. This allows you to trigger automated workflows, such as starting a CI/CD pipeline, whenever changes occur in the bucket.

***

* **Bucket Access Policy (`aws_s3_bucket_policy`)**: This is the most detailed part, setting up specific access rules:
    * **Enforce HTTPS**: It explicitly denies any access to the bucket over non-secure (HTTP) connections, forcing all traffic to use HTTPS.
    * **Grant AWS Amplify Access**: It allows the AWS Amplify service to read build artifacts from specific folders (`cc-frontend-builds`, `cc-backend-builds`, `cc-backend-jars`), indicating the bucket stores deployment packages for an Amplify application.
    * **Grant CI/CD Access**: It gives full access (`s3:*`) to the account's root user and is set up to grant similar permissions to a specific CI/CD IAM role. This allows your deployment pipeline to upload and manage files in the bucket.
