## 2. System Capabilities

### 2.1 Overview
CareConnect unifies clinical coordination, remote monitoring, AI-assisted documentation, billing automation, and family engagement in a single, role-aware experience. Fall 2025 highlights include:
- **EVV workspace** with visit scheduling, GPS or address-based check-in/out, compliance-ready EDI exports, and offline synchronization queues.
- **Invoice & Billing Assistant** for high-volume document intake, AI-powered OCR, duplicate detection, collaborative review, and financial KPIs.
- **Streaming voice diarization** that transcribes multi-speaker conversations, tags participants, and stores structured patient notes.
- **Emergency response tooling** featuring an exportable medical QR card, SOS escalation flows, fall-alert skeleton playback, and integration with smart-home sensors.
- **USPS informed delivery digest** pulling mail previews straight from linked email accounts to assist with medication-by-mail tracking and insurance correspondence.
- **Expanded scheduling and calendar utilities** covering caregiver shift planning, patient calendar assistants, and configurable notification windows.

### 2.2 Dataflow
The multi-tier architecture distributes responsibilities across secure services:
1. **Flutter front-end** applications render dashboards, capture sensor data, perform on-device inference (Sherpa ONNX for speech, AI mood detection), and support offline queues.
2. **Backend services** manage authentication, RBAC policies, visit and invoice persistence, AI orchestration, and notification routing over REST and WebSocket channels.
3. **Data stores** encrypt PHI at rest while maintaining immutable audit logs for EVV, invoice edits, and emergency events.
4. **Integration services** connect to payment processors (Stripe, PayPal), wearable APIs, email providers (Gmail for informed delivery), and AI model endpoints.
5. **Notification engine** aggregates push, SMS, email, and in-app alerts, respecting user-defined quiet hours and escalation rules.

4. After recording, review the transcript, remove sensitive segments, and save to the patient chart. Notes can be exported as PDF or shared with supervisors.

### 4.8 Communication & Telehealth

#### 4.8.1 Messaging & Broadcasts
1. Use `Messages` for one-to-one or group chats. Attach photos, documents, or audio snippets.
2. Mark messages as `High Priority` to escalate notifications.

2. Telehealth Bridge integrates third-party providers; join meetings from within CareConnect without switching apps.
3. Screen share (web) or share files mid-call to collaborate on care plans.

#### 4.8.3 Virtual Check-In Rounds
1. Access `Virtual Check-In` from patient dashboards or the navigation drawer.
2. Configure question sets, cadence, and responsible clinicians.
3. During rounds, clinicians document key observations and mark follow-up actions. Completed rounds feed analytics and trigger notifications if critical responses are captured.

#### 4.8.4 Emergency SOS & QR Escalation
1. Activate SOS by pressing and holding the red button for three seconds.
2. Confirm emergency type (medical, safety, other). CareConnect sends GPS, profile, and contact info to responders.
3. Generate an emergency QR card under `Safety > Emergency QR`. Share or print the card; first responders scan to access vital details and contacts.

#### 4.8.5 Vial of Life Printable Card
1. From the Emergency QR screen, tap `Generate Vial of Life PDF` to build a printable summary of vital medical information and emergency contacts.
2. Review the preview to confirm details such as medications, allergies, and primary physician before printing.
3. Use the `Download` or `Share` buttons to distribute the PDF to caregivers, place it on the refrigerator, or store it in emergency kits.

## 6. Troubleshooting & Support

### 6.1 Common Issues and Solutions
- **Cannot log in:** Verify credentials, ensure MFA device is available, and check for admin-issued forced resets. Use backup codes when offline.
- **EVV check-in fails:** Confirm GPS permissions, ensure the patient address is correct, or switch to manual address entry when indoors.
- **Invoice OCR errors:** Re-upload higher-resolution images, ensure full pages are captured, or manually key critical fields before saving.
- **ASR transcript inaccurate:** Calibrate microphone placement, reduce background noise, and retrain speaker profiles in `AI Configuration`.
- **Fall alert false positives:** Adjust sensor sensitivity, review smart home placement, and mark the alert as false to refine future detection.
- **USPS digest empty:** Reauthorize Gmail access, confirm digest emails are arriving, or enable mock data for demonstration mode.
- **Notifications not received:** Review notification settings, confirm quiet hours, and ensure device-level notification permissions are enabled.

### 6.2 Contact Support
1. Open `Settings > Help Center`.
2. Browse knowledge base articles or submit a support ticket with logs and screenshots.
3. Urgent needs (failed EVV submission, SOS malfunction) trigger priority routing via phone or secure chat. Expect acknowledgment within one hour and full response within 24 hours.
